        I'll lose some sales and my boss won't be happy,<br>
        but I can't stop listening to the sound<br>
        of two soft voices<br>
        blended in perfection<br>
        from the reels of this record that I've found.<br>
        <br>
        Every day there's a boy in the mirror asking me...<br>
        What are you doing here?<br>
        Finding all my previous motives<br>
        growing increasingly unclear.<br>
        
        I've traveled far and I've burned all the bridges<br>
        I believed as soon as I hit land<br>
        all the other options held before me,<br>
        would wither in the light of my plan.<br>
        <br>
        So I'll lose some sales and my boss won't be happy,<br>
        but there's only one thing on my mind<br>
        searching boxes underneath the counter,<br>
        on a chance that on a tape I'd find...<br>
        a song for someone who needs somewhere to long for.<br>
        <br>
        Homesick.<br>
        Because I no longer know where home is.<br>

          He won't touch you anymore,<br>
          Staying at his side.<br>
          Half indifferent, half afraid,<br>
          It will only make you cry.<br>
          <br>
          What is given can't be returned.<br>
          The cards are in our hands.<br>
          All that is living can be hurt,<br>
          And that's the end of innocence.<br>
          <br>
          Second round found you beating death,<br>
          The miracle of life.<br>
          Once each of you caught your breath,<br>
          A question simmers inside.<br>
          <br>
          How far away from being in<br>
          Can there be stated of love?<br>
          How to put it is you're bound within.<br>
          What matter is it made of?<br>
          <br>
          What will we become?<br>
          What will we become?<br>
          What will we become?<br>
          Second to numb.<br>

          I didn't know you were there<br>
          until you said "hello." <br>
          You had been watching me <br>
          for I don't know how long. <br>
          I hit my head against the lamp, <br>
          as by surprise I stood up. <br>
          "Don't be afraid," you said, <br>
          "it's only me- The door wasn't locked." <br>
          <br>
          The voice I'd heard in the hall <br>
          was hard to recognise. <br>
          But now we know he's onboard, <br>
          wearing our disguise. <br>
          If only you and I could trust <br>
          each other through this, <br>
          then together we could <br>
          work out who the enemy is.<br>
