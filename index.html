        Homesick
        I'll lose some sales and my boss won't be happy,
but I can't stop listening to the sound
of two soft voices
blended in perfection
from the reels of this record that I've found.

Every day there's a boy in the mirror asking me...
What are you doing here?
Finding all my previous motives
growing increasingly unclear.

I've traveled far and I've burned all the bridges
I believed as soon as I hit land
all the other options held before me,
would wither in the light of my plan.

So I'll lose some sales and my boss won't be happy,
but there's only one thing on my mind
searching boxes underneath the counter,
on a chance that on a tape I'd find...
a song for someone who needs somewhere to long for.

Homesick.
Because I no longer know where home is.

          Second to Numb
          He won't touch you anymore,
Staying at his side.
Half indifferent, half afraid,
It will only make you cry.

What is given can't be returned.
The cards are in our hands.
All that is living can be hurt,
And that's the end of innocence.

Second round found you beating death,
The miracle of life.
Once each of you caught your breath,
A question simmers inside.

How far away from being in
Can there be stated of love?
How to put it is you're bound within.
What matter is it made of?

What will we become?
What will we become?
What will we become?
Second to numb.

         The Passenger
         
I didn't know you were there
until you said "hello." 
You had been watching me 
for I don't know how long. 
I hit my head against the lamp, 
as by surprise I stood up. 
"Don't be afraid," you said, 
"it's only me- The door wasn't locked." 

The voice I'd heard in the hall 
was hard to recognise. 
But now we know he's onboard, 
wearing our disguise. 
If only you and I could trust 
each other through this, 
then together we could 
work out who the enemy is.
